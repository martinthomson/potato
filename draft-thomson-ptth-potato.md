# Introduction

Operating an HTTP server that is accessable on the public internet
creates an unmanageable risk of denial of service
for many organizations,
especially smaller operators.
Content delivery networks (CDNs) are able to provide a measure of protection,
but their services typically operate as gateways,
which require that the origin server be reachable.

An alternative deployment model has emerged as a means of addressing this concern,
where, rather than have the gateway initiate a connection to the origin,
the origin connects to the gateway.

    |               |                |              |
~~~

This arrangement greatly simplifies the configuration of firewalls,
which are better able to authorize outward-bound connections.

This document defines alternative, "reversed", versions of HTTP {{HTTP}} protocols.
These protocols are all nearly identical to their "forward" counterparts,
with the exception that the client and server roles are inverted
after completing the transport and TLS layer establishment.

This document defines reversed equivalents to
HTTP/1.1 {{RFC9112}},
HTTP/2 {{RFC9113}},
and {{RFC9114}}.


## Comparative Notes

This is one of a set of different options in this space.
Other designs include
reverse tunnels {{?I-D.kazuho-ptth-ptth}}
and reverse HTTP transport {{?I-D.bt-httpbis-reverse-http}}.

These alternatives are all broadly capable of achieving the goal.

Key points of divergence exist around the use of tunnels
(for reverse tunnels)
and how different roles are authenticated and authorized.

There are some minor differences in use of terminology,
which need to be cleared up.


# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

This document uses terminology from {{HTTP}}.

Because having roles reversed can be especially confusing,
this document tries to be consistent in its use of language.

The terms *client* and *server*,
when unqualified,
refer to the HTTP client and HTTP server roles respectively.

In this document, a *gateway* will generally be the HTTP client
and an *origin server* will generally be the HTTP server.
These terms will be used where it makes sense.

Where it is necessary to identify a client or server role
outside of the context of reversed HTTP,
the term will be qualified.
This typically will use the protocol where the role is used.
For example, "TLS client role" or "acting as QUIC client".


# Overview and Scope

This document describes how to establish reversed HTTP connections.

The overall approach is
to allocate new Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) {{!ALPN=RFC7301}}
identifiers to each reversed HTTP version.

The origin server acts in the client role
for establishing the transport and security layers of a connection
to the gateway, which provides a server for those layers.
That is, for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2,
the origin server is the TCP and TLS client
and the gateway is the TCP and TLS server.
For HTTP/3, the origin server is the QUIC client
and the gateway is the QUIC server.

If the gateway selects the reversed HTTP version
in the protocol negotiation,
the corresponding HTTP version is conducted
with the usual roles reversed.
The gateway becomes the HTTP client
and the origin server becomes the HTTP server.
No other changes are made to the protocol.

The document explores some of the implications of this design,
including authorization ({{auth-gateway}} and {{auth-origin}}),
and interactions with some protocol features.
However, there are numerous factors that are relevant
when choosing an appropriate server deployment architecture.
This document will address only those
that are relevant to the design of the protocol
and essential to its secure and correct operation.

This document does not define a protocol
that allows both endpoints to make requests over the same connection.
Separate connections can be used
if requests need to be exchanged in both directions.


# Reversed HTTP

This section defines the basic operation of reversed HTTP
for each major HTTP version.

All versions of reversed HTTP require special handling
for questions of server authority.
Authorizing the origin server is discussed in {{auth-origin}}.
Similarly the means by which a gateway authorizes
an origin server are discussed in {{auth-origin}}.

Most HTTP features,
including extensions to specific HTTP versions,
are unaffected by the reversal of the protocol.

Only those features that depend on lower protocols layers
that also depend on assumptions
about how the the TLS or transport-layer role
relates to the HTTP client or server role.
Such features cannot be used without additional profiling.

The features that cannot be used with reversed HTTP
include:
the Client-Cert HTTP field {{?RFC9440}}.

A small adjustment to the operation of
the HTTP/3 Datagram extension {{!HTTP-DGRAM=RFC9297}}
is described in {{rh3}}.


## Reversed HTTP/1.1 {#rh1}

A reversed version of HTTP/1.1 {{RFC9112}}
is identified by the ALPN label "rh1".

To negotiate the use of reversed HTTP/1.1 protocol,
an origin server advertises the "rh1" token
in its TLS handshake using ALPN {{ALPN}}
and a gateway selects that token.

Once a TLS connection is established,
the origin server (as a TLS client) becomes the HTTP server
and the gateway (as TLS server) becomes the HTTP client.
Messages sent by the gateway are HTTP requests
and messages from the origin server are HTTP responses.

HTTP/1.1 depends only on an undifferentiated stream of bytes.
No special considerations apply to this version.


## Reversed HTTP/2 {#rh2}

A reversed version of HTTP/2 {{RFC9113}}
is identified by the ALPN label "rh2".

To negotiate the use of reversed HTTP/2 protocol,
an origin server advertises the "rh2" token
in its TLS handshake using ALPN {{ALPN}}
and a gateway selects that token.

Once a TLS connection is established,
the origin server (as a TLS client) becomes the HTTP/2 server
and the gateway (as TLS server) becomes the HTTP/2 client.
Each send a preface ({{Section 3.4 of RFC9113}})
and establishes an HTTP connection.

HTTP/2 depends only on an undifferentiated stream of bytes.
No changes are necessary to the base protocol.

In operation, the gateway (as HTTP/2 client) initiates requests
on odd-numbered streams.
Any push promises from the origin server (as HTTP server)
are sent on even-numbered streams.


## Reversed HTTP/3 {#rh3}

A reversed version of HTTP/3 {{RFC9114}}
is identified by the ALPN label "rh3".

To negotiate the use of reversed HTTP/3 protocol,
an origin server advertises the "rh3" token
in its QUIC handshake using ALPN {{ALPN}}
and a gateway selects that token.

Once a QUIC connection is established,
the origin server (as a QUIC client) becomes the HTTP/3 server
and the gateway (as QUIC server) becomes the HTTP/3 client.
Each send a preface ({{Section 3.4 of RFC9113}})
and establishes an HTTP connection.

Unlike HTTP/2, the streaming layer that HTTP/3 uses
is provided by QUIC.
Therefore, the identifiers given to streams change.
This should not be visible to the HTTP/3 layer;
the HTTP/3 design generally does not depend on stream identifiers
being in any particular form.

One exception to this is the Quarter Stream ID concept
introduced in {{Section 2.1 of !HTTP-DGRAM=RFC9297}}.
Because requests in reversed HTTP/3 are made
on bi-directional, server-initiated streams,
those identifiers end with two bits (0b01);
see {{Section 2.1 of !QUIC=RFC9000}}.
To construct a Quarter Stream ID from a stream identifier,
any remainder is discarded.
To construct a stream identifier from a Quarter Stream ID
in reversed HTTP/3,
the value is multiplied by 4,
then the stream type (0b01) is added.
This adjustment only requires an understanding of the type of QUIC stream
that the HTTP client uses to make requests.

Any extension that makes similar assumptions
about the structure of stream identifiers
can be adjusted in a similar manner.


# Authenticating and Authorizing Origin Servers {#auth-origin}

Arrangements between gateways and origin servers
are often privately arranged.
Therefore, how a gateway chooses to authorize an origin server
does not necessarily benefit from having a single, standard mechanism.

This section describes a few options
for origin server authentication.
None of these approaches is mandated,
as it is expected that private arrangements will be used
in most deployments.


## TLS Client Certificates {#client-cert}

TLS client certificates can be used to authenticate TLS clients.
That authentication could be used as the basis of authorization.

The choice of how to authenticate a client certificate is complex.
Multiple options are possible,
each with different operational and deployment properties:

* The gateway could use the same public key infrastructure (PKI) as the certificate
  that the gateway itself offers (see {{auth-gateway}}).

* A completely separate PKI could be used.
  This includes a PKI managed by the gateway.

* Self-signed certificates could be mapped
  to specific authorizations.

This option might introduce some challenges in deployment.
Because the TLS connection that is established to the gateway
uses the same endpoint that other clients,
the TLS server software needs to make its protocol selection
before deciding to request a client certificate.


## HTTP Request

Once a reversed HTTP connection is established,
the gateway could make a request to a pre-arranged resource.

This request could be used to retrieve a bearer token
that authorizes the origin server.
A more complex request
might involve the origin server producing a signed object
that covers a challenge produced by the gateway.
Responding to a challenge is a defense
against the possibility of an attack
that captures and replays a bearer token.

TODO: Should this document define a protocol?


## Authorization for Limited Path Scope

A gateway does not need to authorize an origin server
to serve all requests for an origin.
Nor does a gateway need to limit its authorization
to a single origin.

The choice of which requests are forwarded to an origin server
is a matter for gateway policy.
That policy might be guided by the choice of credential
presented by the origin server.

For instance, if a HTTP request is used
to authorize the origin server,
the response might include information
that guides the gateway in determining
which requests are forwarded over the connection.
This could be as simple as
having the origin server list path prefixes that it can serve
or it could be bound to the credentials that are offered.

This might be used to enable different deployment architectures
where the one logical origin server is distributed
across multiple instances,
with different paths being served by different hosts.

This approach is also compatible with a gateway
that makes regular HTTP connections to some origin server nodes.
A gateway might forward requests
for the one origin
to origin servers that use both regular and reversed HTTP
based on whatever policy it chooses.


# Authenticating Gateways {#auth-gateway}

An origin server MUST authenticate a gateway
unless an alternative means of authentication
is privately arranged.

In all reversed HTTP versions,
when the the origin server establishes a TLS connection
to the gateway,
it confirms the identity of the gateway
according to the rules of the respective, non-reversed, HTTP version.

The rules in {{Section 4.3 of HTTP}}
regarding how clients determine whether a server can answer a request
are applied in reverse.
That is, an origin server that cannot successfully determine
that a gateway is authoritative for resources
MUST NOT answer requests from that gateway.

Because the server and client roles are reversed,
some methods for expanding the scope that a server can claim authority
are invalidated.
Mechanisms like the ORIGIN frame {{?ORIGIN=RFC8336}} remain valid
as a means of limiting scope.

These requirements do not exist to provide protection against impersonation,
which is generally the reason to require that a server establish authority.
They exist to protect things like the confidentiality of responses.

TODO: For discovery, should this use
generic SVCB records, HTTPS records, or a new RR type?
It seems like HTTPS will work just fine for this.


# TLS Early Data {#early}

A gateway can use TLS session resumption
to make establishing connections more efficient.
This includes the possibility of enabling TLS early data.

Unlike in regular HTTP
where a client can use TLS early data to make a request,
reversed HTTP gives the server an opportunity to speak first.
This has little value,
as an HTTP server generally has to wait for requests.

This provides similar properties to the first flight of server application data
in a TLS 1.3 connection without early data.
There, the server is able to send first.

Though that data has no replay risk,
the data that a server might send in any HTTP version without a request
is unlikely to produce side effects
that might be a problem if replayed.

An origin can use early data to
reduce the latency of settings
or pre-populate header compression state.
These both only apply to HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.
These uses can avoid any replay attack risk,
as these do not cause side effects beyond the connection state.

For a gateway,
the first flight of application data can be used to make requests.
However, this data is sent prior to receiving client certificates
if those are used to authorize the origin server; see {{client-cert}}.
This flight might be used for making a request to authorize the origin server;
see {{auth-origin}}.


# Scalability, Availability, and Connection Management {#sacm}

A gateway that is configured to make connections to an origin server
is able to make connections as needed.
Having the origin server be responsible for connection establishment
can mean that the gateway cannot rely on being able
to make new connection as demand increases.

This can mean that origin servers have a greater control
over their availability and service scaling.
Where an origin server that might need to scale up
to handle increased demand
might otherwise need to arrange for load balancing infrastructure,
that becomes something that the gateway assumes more responsibilty for.

As a passive participant,
a gateway is not able to act if an origin server goes offline.
The origin server is responsible for establishing connections
when it becomes available.

This can present scaling challenges
as a gateway cannot make additional connections
on the assumption that origin servers will scale to meet increased demand.
Gateways can attempt to make additional requests over existing connections,
but origin servers can use protocol features
designed to limit resource commitment --
such as stream limits and flow control --
to manage load.

This document does not define any mechanism
that might allow the gateway to communicate
changes in demand for capacity to origin server instances.
Defining mechanisms to help
with adding or removing capacity on demand
is a matter for future work.

The use of reversed HTTP/1.1 presents particular difficulty
for connection management,
which is borne by the origin server.
The lack of any concurrency features in that protocol
means that origin servers likely need to manage
a pool of connections
if the gateway needs to handle requests
with any amount of concurrency or volume.


# Security Considerations

Using reversed HTTP changes the denial of service profile
for origin servers that rely on it.
Such servers are able to use different tools
to manage their reachability.

A gateway becomes a more central part of managing load,
but the gateway no longer has direct control over connection establishment.
This alters how gateways and origin servers need to be configured
to handle scaling, availability, and connections;
see {{sacm}} for details.

Other than these changes, the security considerations of HTTP
and the specific HTTP version in use apply in full.
